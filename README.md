# PepperDocs Information

I wrote the PepperDocs documentation while working on a project programming the humanoid robot Pepper for my practical training at Tampere University of Applied Sciences (TAMK). The purpose of PepperDocs was to help my teammates and anyone else starting work on programming Pepper in the future.

The document contains instructions for setting up your environment for developing code for the Pepper robot in the Android Studio IDE. The document also includes some fixes for potential issues. There are also some useful tips, as well as limitations we faced during development of our own projects.
